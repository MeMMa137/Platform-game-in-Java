This Java code allows you to play a mini-platform-game with enemies and missions.

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Apache NetBeans IDE 16 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
You can play it directly from the IDE or using programs that support the graphical interface of .java files.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order to avoid encountering errors.
